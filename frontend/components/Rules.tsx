        <li>Please use your real name and not an alias or username</li>
        <li>You can challenge people up to 5 places above you and if you win you leapfrog above them in the ladder.</li>
        <li>If you are challenged and you lose you will move down one place as the challenger leaps above you. If you win there is no change in positions.</li>
        <li>If you are challenged you have 3 days to respond. You can deny the challenge. If you don‚Äôt respond within that time frame you lose the match.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />

        <li>Make sure you have a decent set of balls.</li>
        <li>You call whether the ball was in or out on your side of the net. The opponent must accept your call but if you aren‚Äôt sure you can offer to play a let.</li>
        <li>If play is interrupted in anyway play a let.</li>
        <li>The server is responsible for keeping score, and should shout it out before the beginning of each point.</li>
